# Day 6 – Introduction to Excel

Today I spent time getting familiar with Excel and realized it’s much more than a spreadsheet.

## What I learned today

- **Workbook vs Worksheet:** A workbook is the whole project file, and a worksheet is a dataset inside it.  
- **Rows and Columns:** Rows represent observations, columns represent variables or characteristics of each observation.  
- **Ribbon:** It reflects the workflow of working with data — collecting, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and sharing.  
- **Cells:** Each cell is a unit where data or formulas live.  
- **Data Types:** Numbers, text, dates, and logical (TRUE/FALSE).  
- **Messy Data:** Happens when types are mixed in the same column or when rows/columns aren’t consistent.

## Reflection

What clicked for me today is that Excel works because of structure and logic, not magic. I’m curious to see how all this applies when I start working with real datasets instead of just blank sheets.

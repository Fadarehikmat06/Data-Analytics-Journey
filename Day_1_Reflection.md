# Day 1: Learning Data Analytics

## What I Learned Today
Today I learned that data is just raw facts until it’s collected, cleaned, analyzed, and turned into useful insights for decision-making.

## Types of Analysis
- **Descriptive:** What happened  
- **Diagnostic:** Why it happened  
- **Predictive:** What might happen  
- **Prescriptive:** What should be done

## Reflection
I’m still a beginner, but it’s starting to click that a data analyst is the bridge between raw data and decision-makers.

Shared my reflection on X and LinkedIn today.

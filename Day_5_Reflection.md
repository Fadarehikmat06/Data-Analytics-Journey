# Day 5 – Data Analytics Journey
# Focus: Time Series Analysis

# Explored how data behaves over time:
# Components:
   Trend          : overall direction of the data
   
   Seasonality    : repeating patterns at fixed intervals (e.g., December sales spike)
   
   Cyclical       : long-term fluctuations without fixed intervals
   
   Noise          : random or irregular events (e.g., pandemic, strike)

# Models:
   Additive       : seasonality stays constant
#                    Y = Trend + Seasonality + Noise
   Multiplicative : seasonality grows with the data
#                    Y = Trend * Seasonality * Noise

# Key takeaway:
   Decomposing time series data helps identify trends, seasonality, cycles, and noise
  → allows for better insights and informed decisions

# Next step:
Practice decomposing real datasets to spot patterns more clearly

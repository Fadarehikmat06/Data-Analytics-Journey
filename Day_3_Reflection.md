# Day 3 of Learning Data Analytics

## Topic: Correlation and Probability

Today I worked on **correlation** and **probability**. At first, I was a bit confused, but after thinking through examples, things started to click.

### Key Learnings:

- **Correlation ≠ Causation**  
  Just because two things are related doesn’t mean one causes the other.  
  *Example:* Coffee and heart disease might appear related, but a third factor (the **confounding variable**) like smoking could be the real cause.

- **Probability vs Correlation**  
  - **Correlation**: Shows if things are related.  
  - **Probability**: Shows how likely something is to happen.  
    *Example:* The chance of drawing a red card from a deck 

It’s slow going, but I am starting to understand how these ideas fit together.  
**Next step:** The next thing I want to see is how  correlation and probability usage appear in real datasets using Excel.

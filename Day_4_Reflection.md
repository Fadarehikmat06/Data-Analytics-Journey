# Day 4 – Regression & Hypothesis Testing

Today I spent time diving into **regression** and **hypothesis testing**.

---

## Regression
I realized that **correlation** only tells me that two variables are related, but it doesn’t show how a change in one affects the other.  
Regression actually tries to **quantify the relationship**.  
It can also consider **other factors that might influence the outcome**, which made me think about how messy real-world data can be.

## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing clicked differently.  
- We start by assuming there’s **no effect** — the null hypothesis.  
- Then we check how likely a claim could happen by chance.  
- The **p-value** tells us whether we can trust the claim or not.

## Reflection
Seeing how **regression and hypothesis testing work together** is starting to make sense, but I still feel like I’m only scratching the surface.

Has anyone else struggled with p-values when starting out? What helped it click for you?
